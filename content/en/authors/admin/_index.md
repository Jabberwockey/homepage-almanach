Bartholomäus Federkiel, played by Jens Grabarske, is the former director of the City Theatre of Aldradach. After a night full of drinks he took on the job of maintaining
the [Aldradach-Almanach](http://www.aldradach-almanach.de) from the original author, Ludovic the Player. In the beginning he just wanted to do this project on the side to
be able to get to know the town of Aldradach better. But step by step Bartholomäus discovered his love for the written word. With the Aldradacher Skriptorium he not only
wants to continue looking after the Aldradach Almanac, he also works on other projects and helps aspiring authors to find readers for their books.
